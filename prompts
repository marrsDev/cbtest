I'm trying to update my website's UI to look exactly like https://www.python.org landing page. Can you create a working HTML and CSS code for it? Your generated index.html code should be able to run without problems and be fully responsive for different screen sizes using media queries. I will share the code that I have so far in my next prompt. 
My current HTML and one of the css code will be shared in the same prompt while the second css code for media queries will be shared as a file. Please let me know if this is possible.

We were making the UI of a construction web application to calculate the cost of assembling windows. Currently we're working on the interface. Attached is the Html and css files of the progress so far.

Can we continue from where we left off with the UI for a cost calculating website? Attached are the html and Css files so far.




1. Refine the Hero Section
Responsive Design: Ensure the hero section looks great on all screen sizes, especially on mobile devices.

Image Preview: Add more interactivity to the image preview in the right section, such as zooming or rotating the window image based on user selections.

Gradient Effects: Enhance the gradient effects in the left section to make it more visually appealing.

2. Add More Features
Additional Configuration Options: You could add more options for users to customize their windows, such as:

Frame Material: Allow users to choose between different materials (e.g., aluminium, wood, PVC).

Window Type: Add more window types (e.g., sliding, casement, tilt-and-turn).

Energy Efficiency: Include options for energy-efficient glass or frames.

Dynamic Cost Calculation: Improve the cost calculation logic to reflect more accurate pricing based on the selected options.

3. Enhance the Features Section
Interactive Cards: Make the feature cards in the "Features" section more interactive, such as adding hover effects or clickable elements that expand to show more details.

Icons: Add icons to each feature card to make them more visually appealing and easier to understand at a glance.

4. Improve the Footer
Social Media Links: Add more social media links (e.g., Instagram, LinkedIn) and ensure they are properly linked.

Contact Information: Include a contact form or additional contact information (e.g., phone number, email) in the footer.

Newsletter Signup: Add a newsletter signup form to the footer to capture user emails.

5. Add Animations
Smooth Transitions: Add smooth transitions and animations to elements like buttons, dropdowns, and images to make the UI feel more dynamic.

Loading Animations: If the cost calculation takes time, consider adding a loading animation to keep users engaged.

6. Accessibility Improvements
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements (e.g., dropdowns, buttons) are accessible via keyboard navigation.

ARIA Labels: Add ARIA labels to improve accessibility for screen readers.

Contrast Check: Ensure all text has sufficient contrast against its background for better readability.

7. Testing and Debugging
Cross-Browser Testing: Test the web app on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure compatibility.

Mobile Testing: Test the app on various mobile devices to ensure it works well on smaller screens.

Performance Optimization: Optimize images, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure fast loading times.

8. Add a "Save Configuration" Feature
Save and Load Configurations: Allow users to save their window configurations and load them later. This could be done using local storage or by generating a unique URL.

9. Add a "Share Configuration" Feature
Share via Link: Allow users to share their custom window configuration via a link. This could be useful for getting quotes from contractors or sharing with family members.

10. Add a "Compare Configurations" Feature
Side-by-Side Comparison: Allow users to compare different window configurations side-by-side to see the differences in cost, materials, and features.
